# Clam Tutorial #

This tutorial contains several small programs that show some of the
nice capabilities of Clam.

Run all programs with `lit`:

``` 
lit --param test_dir=. ./
```

This tutorial also includes a standalone LLVM static analyzer by using
the C++ Clam API. The code of the full analyzer is in
`api-example/myanalyzer.cpp`.
